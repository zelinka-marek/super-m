# SuperMarket

This is the final project, created after completing the course [React Tutorial](https://react-tutorial.app/). This project is a Ecommerce app that allows users to get fresh products. I've learned modern React from scratch and build an online supermarket shopping app with Stripe integration. I've used Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling.

Here's a list of some of the topics that I applied in this project:

- Virtual DOM
- Working with JSX
- Working with Forms
- Using fetch APIs
- React hooks, like the Effect hook and State hook
- Writing custom hooks
- Context/Provider patterns
- React Router
