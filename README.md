# SuperMarket

> This project is the final challenge in [React Tutorial](https://react-tutorial.app/) course.

This project is a Ecommerce app that allows users to get fresh products. I've learned modern React from scratch and build an online supermarket shopping app with Stripe integration. I've used Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling.
